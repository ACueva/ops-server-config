-Before running the Ops Server installer:

   1. You need to uninstall the following software products 
      if they are already installed:
	- ArcGIS for Server
	- Portal for ArcGIS
	- GeoEvent Processor Extension for ArcGIS Server 
  	- PostgreSQL
	- ArcGIS for Desktop
	- Chat Server (Openfire)
 
   2. Set the variables in the "Set Variables" section in 
       the InstallSettings.bat file.

   3. Run the InstallIIS.bat which:
        - Installs IIS and all the IIS components required
          by ArcGIS Server (run this script even if you have
          already installed IIS; this will ensure that all the
          required IIS components are installed).

        - Installs .net framework.

        - Sets the IIS default document.

        - Installs any IIS MIME types required for Ops Server.
